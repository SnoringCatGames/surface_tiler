_(FIXME: description) a library for [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)._

_Next-level autotiling._

Some features include:
-   90Â° and 45Â° surfaces.
-   Exterior-to-interior art transitions spanning two subtiles.
-   Dynamically constructed subtiles from individual constituent quadrants according to the local topography of the corresponding cell in the TileMap.
-   A corner-type annotation system for defining the shapes of each quadrant in the tileset.

> **NOTE:** _This framework depends the separate [Scaffolder](https://github.com/snoringcatgames/scaffolder/) library._

<!-- FIXME: Add a GIF showing the autotiling in action! -->
