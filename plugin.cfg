name="Surface Tiler"
description="Advanced autotiling:
- Supports 90° and 45° surfaces.
- Supports exterior-to-interior art transitions spanning two subtiles.
- Dynamically constructs each subtile by separately selecting each of its four constituent quadrants according to the local topography of the corresponding cell in the TileMap.
- Uses a corner-type annotation system for defining the shapes of each quadrant in the tileset."
